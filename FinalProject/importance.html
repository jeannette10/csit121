            <h2>Enhancing Performance</h2>
            <p>CSS Containment is crucial for optimizing web performance. When developers specify containment for elements, browsers can process pages faster by reducing unnecessary reflows and repaints. This results in a **smoother user experience** and improved responsiveness.</p>
            <p>For example, when using `contain: layout`, an element's dimensions and positioning are calculated independently, preventing unnecessary layout recalculations when other elements change.</p>
            <p>By limiting the impact of an element on the rest of the page, CSS Containment **significantly improves rendering efficiency**, making it ideal for complex web applications.</p>

            <h2>Better Isolation of Elements</h2>
            <p>Web developers often work with modular components that should function independently. CSS Containment ensures elements remain **isolated**, preventing styles, layout, and rendering issues from spilling over to other parts of the webpage.</p>
            <p>Using `contain: style` ensures that styles applied within a contained element do not affect the surrounding elements. This is especially beneficial when working on dynamic UI components like **modals, pop-ups, or embedded widgets**.</p>
            <p>Containment helps maintain the integrity of different sections within a website, making design and maintenance **more predictable and manageable**.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing Memory Usage</h2>
            <p>Browsers use **memory and processing power** to render web pages. By applying containment, developers can **reduce memory usage**, allowing for efficient rendering of large-scale applications.</p>
            <p>The `contain: paint` property ensures that an element's contents are painted **only within its defined bounds**, preventing unnecessary rendering operations. This is useful for animations or components that frequently update.</p>
            <p>Overall, CSS Containment enables better **resource management**, reducing computational overhead and ensuring smoother performance across different devices.</p>
